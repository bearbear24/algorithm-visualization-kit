h1.Overview

This project is a part of the *Open Labs* project. It aims to build a graphic-driven library for algorithm visualization. It is similar to the one developed by "David Galles":http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/ of "University of San Francisco":http://www.usfca.edu[1], but I tried to make it simpler and easier to use.
